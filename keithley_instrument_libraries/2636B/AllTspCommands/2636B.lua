--- **This function establishes a network connection with another LAN instrument or device through the LAN interface.**
---
--- *Type:*  Function
---
--- *Details:*<br>
--- This command connects a device to another device through the LAN interface. If the portNumber is 23, the interface uses the Telnet protocol and sets appropriate termination characters to communicate with the device.If a portNumber and initString are provided, it is assumed that the remote device is not TSP‑enabled. The 2600B does not perform any extra processing, prompt handling, error handling, or sending of commands. In addition, the tspnet.tsp.* commands cannot be used on devices that are not TSP‑enabled.If neither a portNumber nor an initString is provided, the remote device is assumed to be a Keithley Instruments TSP‑enabled device. Depending on the state of the tspnet.tsp.abortonconnect attribute, the 2600B sends an abort command to the remote device on connection. The 2600B also enables TSP prompts on the remote device and error management. The 2600B places remote errors from the TSP‑enabled device in its own error queue and prefaces these errors with Remote Error, followed by an error description. Do not manually change either the prompt functionality (localnode.prompts) or show errors by changing localnode.showerrors on the remote TSP-enabled device. If you do this, subsequent tspnet.tsp.* commands using the connection may fail.You can simultaneously connect to a maximum of 32 remote devices.

--- **This function sends a command string to the remote device.**
---
--- *Type:*  Function
---
--- *Details:*<br>
--- This command sends a command string to the remote instrument. A termination is added to the command string when it is sent to the remote instrument (tspnet.termination()). You can also specify a format string, which causes the command to wait for a response from the remote instrument. The 2600B decodes the response message according to the format specified in the format string and returns the message as return values from the function (see tspnet.read() for format specifiers).When this command is sent to a TSP-enabled instrument, the 2600B suspends operation until a timeout error is generated or until the instrument responds. The TSP prompt from the remote instrument is read and discarded. The 2600B places any remotely generated errors into its error queue. When the optional format string is not specified, this command is equivalent to tspnet.write(), except that a termination is automatically added to the end of the command.

If no data is available, the 2600B pauses operation until the requested data is available or until a timeout error is generated. Use tspnet.timeout to specify the timeout period.When the 2600B reads from a TSP-enabled remote instrument, the 2600B removes Test Script Processor (TSP®) prompts and places any errors it receives from the remote instrument into its own error queue.

--- *Details:*<br>
--- This function returns result, which is value with a field of bits overwritten, starting at index. The index specifies the position of the least significant bit of value. The width bits starting at index are set to fieldValue.The least significant bit of value is at index position 1; the most significant bit is at index position 32.Before setting the field of bits, any fractional parts of value and fieldValue are truncated to form integers.If fieldValue is wider than width, the most significant bits of the fieldValue that exceed the width are truncated. For example, if width is 4 bits and the binary value for fieldValue is 11110 (5 bits), the most significant bit of fieldValue is truncated and a binary value of 1110 is used.

When + is not selected for format, the minimum limit must be more than or equal to zero (0). When limits are used, you cannot enter values above or below these limits.The input value is limited to ±1e37.Before calling display.inputvalue(), you should send a message prompt to the operator using display.prompt(). Make sure to position the cursor where the edit field should appear.After this command is sent, script execution pauses until you enter a value and press the ENTER key.For positive and negative entry (plus sign (+) used for the value field and the exponent field), polarity of a nonzero value or exponent can be toggled by positioning the cursor on the polarity sign and turning the navigation wheel. Polarity is also toggled when using the navigation wheel to decrease or increase the value or exponent past zero. A zero (0) value or exponent (for example, +00) is always positive and cannot be toggled to negative polarity.After executing this command and pressing the EXIT (LOCAL) key, the function returns nil.

After the first write, you need to use display.clear() to clear the message.The display.clear(), display.setcursor(), and display.settext() functions are overlapped commands. That is, the script does not wait for one of these commands to complete. These functions do not immediately update the display. For performance considerations, they update the display as soon as processing time becomes available.The text starts at the present cursor position. After the text is displayed, the cursor is after the last character in the display message.Top line text does not wrap to the bottom line of the display automatically. Any text that does not fit on the current line is truncated. If the text is truncated, the cursor remains at the end of the line.The text remains on the display until replaced or cleared.The character codes described in the following table can also be included in the text string.

--- **This function prompts the user to enter a parameter from the front panel of the instrument.**
---
--- *Type:*  Function
---
--- *Details:*<br>
--- This function creates an editable input field at the present cursor position, and an input prompt message on the bottom line. Example of a displayed input field and prompt:0.00VInput 0 to +2VThe format parameter uses zeros (0), the decimal point, polarity sign, and exponents to define how the input field is formatted.The format parameter can include the options shown in the following table.You can use the minimum and maximum parameters to limit the values that can be entered. When a plus sign (+) is not selected for format, the minimum limit must be greater than or equal to zero (0). When limits are used, the operator cannot enter values above or below these limits.The input value is limited to ±1e37.After sending this command, script execution pauses for the operator to enter a value and press ENTER.For positive and negative entry (plus sign (+) used for the value field and the exponent field), polarity of a nonzero value or exponent can be toggled by positioning the cursor on the polarity sign and turning the navigation wheel. Polarity also toggles when using the navigation wheel to decrease or increase the value or exponent past zero. A zero value or exponent (for example, +00) is always positive and cannot be toggled to negative polarity.After executing this command and pressing the EXIT (LOCAL) key, the value returns nil.

--- A history of the key code for the last pressed front‑panel key is maintained by the instrument. When the instrument is turned on, or when it is transitioning from local to remote operation, the key code is set to 0 (display.KEY_NONE).Pressing the EXIT (LOCAL) key normally aborts a script. To use this function with the EXIT (LOCAL) key, you must set display.locallockout to display.LOCK.The table below lists the keyCode value for each front‑panel action.You cannot use this function to track the OUTPUT ON/OFF controls for SMU A or SMU B.

--- After you send this function, script execution pauses until a front‑panel action (for example, pressing a key or the navigation wheel, or turning the navigation wheel). After the action, the value of the key (or action) is returned.If the EXIT (LOCAL) key is pressed while this function is waiting for a front‑panel action, the script is not aborted.A typical use for this function is to prompt the user to press the EXIT (LOCAL) key to abort the script or press any other key to continue. For example, if the keyCode value 75 is returned (the EXIT (LOCAL) key was pressed), you can call the exit() function to abort the script.The table below lists the keyCode values for each front panel action.

---
--- *Type:*  Attribute_RW
---
--- *Details:*<br>
--- Assigning a value to this attribute enables or disables the reading buffer cache. When enabled, the reading buffer cache improves access speed to reading buffer data. If you run successive operations that overwrite reading buffer data, the reading buffer may return stale cache data. This can happen when initiating successive sweeps without reconfiguring the sweep measurements or when overwriting data in the reading buffer by setting the bufferVar.fillmode attribute to smuX.FILL_WINDOW. To avoid this, make sure that you include commands that automatically invalidate the cache as needed (for example, explicit calls to the bufferVar.clearcache() function) or disable the cache using this attribute (bufferVar.cachemode).

--- **This attribute sets the reading buffer fill count.**
---
--- *Type:*  Attribute_RW
---
--- *Details:*<br>
--- The reading buffer fill count sets the number of readings to store before restarting at index 1. If the value is zero (0), then the capacity of the buffer is used. Use this attribute to control when the SMU restarts filling the buffer at index 1, rather than having it restart when the buffer is full. If the bufferVar.fillcount attribute is set to a value higher than the capacity of the buffer, after storing the element at the end of the buffer, the SMU overwrites the reading at index 1, the reading after that overwrites the reading at index 2, and so on.This attribute is only used when the bufferVar.fillmode attribute is set to smuX.FILL_WINDOW.For dedicated reading buffers, all buffer attributes are saved to nonvolatile memory only when the reading buffer is saved to nonvolatile memory.

--- When this attribute is set to smuX.FILL_ONCE, the reading buffer does not overwrite readings. If the buffer fills up, new readings are discarded. When this attribute is set to smuX.FILL_WINDOW, new readings are added after existing data until the buffer holds bufferVar.fillcount elements. Continuing the sequence, the next reading overwrites the reading at index 1, the reading after that overwrites the reading at index 2, and so on.

--- **This attribute enables or disables automatic updates to the internal reference measurements (autozero) of the instrument.**
---
--- *Type:*  Attribute_RW
---
--- *Details:*<br>
--- The analog-to-digital converter (ADC) uses a ratiometric A/D conversion technique. To ensure the accuracy of readings, the instrument must periodically obtain new measurements of its internal ground and voltage reference. The time interval between updates to these reference measurements is determined by the integration aperture being used for measurements. The 2600B uses separate reference and zero measurements for each aperture.By default, the instrument automatically checks these reference measurements whenever a signal measurement is made. If the reference measurements have expired when a signal measurement is made, the instrument automatically takes two more A/D conversions, one for the reference and one for the zero, before returning the result. Thus, occasionally, a measurement takes more time than normal.This additional time can cause problems in sweeps and other test sequences in which measurement timing is critical. To avoid the time that is needed for the reference measurements in these situations, you can use the smuX.measure.autozero attribute to disable the automatic reference measurements.Disabling automatic reference measurements may allow the instrument to gradually drift out of specification. To minimize the drift, make a reference and zero measurement immediately before any critical test sequences. You can use the smuX.AUTOZERO_ONCE setting to force a refresh of the reference and zero measurements that are used for the present aperture setting.

This happens when a current measurement command is executed, when the measure action is being performed in a sweep, or after changing ranges during an autoranged measurement.If smuX.measure.count is greater than 1, the measurement delay is only inserted before the first measurement.

--- **This attribute contains the positive full‑scale value of the measurement range for voltage or current.**
---
--- *Type:*  Attribute_RW
---
--- *Details:*<br>
--- Reading this attribute returns the positive full-scale value of the measurement range that the SMU is currently using. Assigning a value to this attribute sets the SMU on a fixed range large enough to measure the assigned value. The instrument selects the best range for measuring a value of rangeValue.This attribute is primarily intended to eliminate the time that is required by the automatic range selection performed by a measuring instrument. Because selecting a fixed range prevents autoranging, an overrange condition can occur. For example, measuring 10.0 V on the 2601B, 2602B, or 2604B 6 V range or measuring 5.0 V on the 2611B, 2612B, or 2614B 2 V range causes an overrange. The value 9.91000E+37 is returned when this occurs. If the source function is the same as the measurement function (for example, sourcing voltage and measuring voltage), the measurement range is locked to be the same as the source range. However, the setting for the measure range is retained. If the source function is changed (for example, from sourcing voltage to sourcing current), the retained measurement range is used.2601B, 2602B, or 2604B example: Assume the source function is voltage. The source range is 1 V and you set the measure range for 6 V. Since the source range is 1 V, the SMU performs voltage measurements on the 1 V range. If you now change the source function to current, voltage measurements are made on the 6 V range.Explicitly setting a measure range disables measure autoranging for that function. Autoranging is controlled separately for each source and measurement function: source voltage, source current, measure voltage and measure current. Autoranging is enabled for all four by default.Changing the range while the output is off does not update the hardware settings, but querying returns the range setting that is used when the output is turned on. Setting a range while the output is on takes effect immediately.With measure autoranging enabled, the range is changed only when a measurement is made. Querying the range after a measurement returns the range selected for that measurement.

---
--- *Type:*  Attribute_RW
---
--- *Details:*<br>
--- This attribute indicates the measurement autorange state. Its value is smuX.AUTORANGE_OFF when the SMU measure circuit is on a fixed range and smuX.AUTORANGE_ON when it is in autorange mode.Setting this attribute to smuX.AUTORANGE_OFF puts the SMU on a fixed range. The fixed range is the present SMU measure range.Setting this attribute to smuX.AUTORANGE_ON puts the SMU measure circuit in autorange mode. It remains on its present measure range until the next measurement is requested.If source high capacitance mode is enabled, current autorange is set to smuX.AUTORANGE_FOLLOW_LIMIT and cannot be changed.

--- **This attribute enables or disables automatic updates to the internal reference measurements (autozero) of the instrument.**
---
--- *Type:*  Attribute_RW
---
--- *Details:*<br>
--- The analog-to-digital converter (ADC) uses a ratiometric A/D conversion technique. To ensure the accuracy of readings, the instrument must periodically obtain new measurements of its internal ground and voltage reference. The time interval between updates to these reference measurements is determined by the integration aperture being used for measurements. The 2600B uses separate reference and zero measurements for each aperture.By default, the instrument automatically checks these reference measurements whenever a signal measurement is made. If the reference measurements have expired when a signal measurement is made, the instrument automatically takes two more A/D conversions, one for the reference and one for the zero, before returning the result. Thus, occasionally, a measurement takes more time than normal.This additional time can cause problems in sweeps and other test sequences in which measurement timing is critical. To avoid the time that is needed for the reference measurements in these situations, you can use the smuX.measure.autozero attribute to disable the automatic reference measurements.Disabling automatic reference measurements may allow the instrument to gradually drift out of specification. To minimize the drift, make a reference and zero measurement immediately before any critical test sequences. You can use the smuX.AUTOZERO_ONCE setting to force a refresh of the reference and zero measurements that are used for the present aperture setting.

---
--- *Type:*  Attribute_RW

--- *Details:*<br>
--- This attribute allows for additional delay (settling time) before making a measurement.

--- **This attribute contains the positive full‑scale value of the measurement range for voltage or current.**
---
--- *Type:*  Attribute_RW
---
--- *Details:*<br>
--- Reading this attribute returns the positive full-scale value of the measurement range that the SMU is currently using. Assigning a value to this attribute sets the SMU on a fixed range large enough to measure the assigned value. The instrument selects the best range for measuring a value of rangeValue.This attribute is primarily intended to eliminate the time that is required by the automatic range selection performed by a measuring instrument. Because selecting a fixed range prevents autoranging, an overrange condition can occur. For example, measuring 10.0 V on the 2601B, 2602B, or 2604B 6 V range or measuring 5.0 V on the 2611B, 2612B, or 2614B 2 V range causes an overrange. The value 9.91000E+37 is returned when this occurs. If the source function is the same as the measurement function (for example, sourcing voltage and measuring voltage), the measurement range is locked to be the same as the source range. However, the setting for the measure range is retained. If the source function is changed (for example, from sourcing voltage to sourcing current), the retained measurement range is used.2601B, 2602B, or 2604B example: Assume the source function is voltage. The source range is 1 V and you set the measure range for 6 V. Since the source range is 1 V, the SMU performs voltage measurements on the 1 V range. If you now change the source function to current, voltage measurements are made on the 6 V range.Explicitly setting a measure range disables measure autoranging for that function. Autoranging is controlled separately for each source and measurement function: source voltage, source current, measure voltage and measure current. Autoranging is enabled for all four by default.Changing the range while the output is off does not update the hardware settings, but querying returns the range setting that is used when the output is turned on. Setting a range while the output is on takes effect immediately.With measure autoranging enabled, the range is changed only when a measurement is made. Querying the range after a measurement returns the range selected for that measurement.

The smuX.source.offfunc attribute controls whether the SMU is configured as a 0 V voltage source or a 0 A current source. When the SMU is operating as a 0 A current source, the smuX.source.offlimitv attribute sets the voltage limit (similar to how the smuX.source.offlimiti attribute sets the current limit when the SMU is operating as a 0 V voltage source).When the sourceOffMode is set to smuX.OUTPUT_ZERO, the source is configured to output 0 V just as smuX.OUTPUT_NORMAL mode with smuX.source.offfunc = smuX.OUTPUT_DCVOLTS.

--- **This attribute contains the source range.**
---
--- *Type:*  Attribute_RW
---
--- *Details:*<br>
--- This attribute contains a value that sets the source‑measure unit (SMU) to a fixed range large enough to source the value. When read, the attribute contains the range the instrument is presently on when in autorange.Assigning a value to this attribute sets the SMU to a fixed range large enough to source the assigned value. The instrument selects the best range for sourcing a value of rangeValue.Reading this attribute returns the positive full-scale value of the source range the SMU is currently using. With source autoranging enabled, the output level controls the range. Querying the range after the level is set returns the range the instrument chose as appropriate for that source level.This attribute is primarily intended to eliminate the time required by the automatic range selection performed by a sourcing instrument. Because selecting a fixed range prevents autoranging, an overrange condition can occur. For example, sourcing 10.0 V on the Model 2601B, 2602B, or 2604B 6 V range or sourcing 5.0 V on the 2611B, 2612B, or 2614B 2 V range causes an overrange condition.

--- **This attribute contains the source range.**
---
--- *Type:*  Attribute_RW
---
--- *Details:*<br>
--- This attribute contains a value that sets the source‑measure unit (SMU) to a fixed range large enough to source the value. When read, the attribute contains the range the instrument is presently on when in autorange.Assigning a value to this attribute sets the SMU to a fixed range large enough to source the assigned value. The instrument selects the best range for sourcing a value of rangeValue.Reading this attribute returns the positive full-scale value of the source range the SMU is currently using. With source autoranging enabled, the output level controls the range. Querying the range after the level is set returns the range the instrument chose as appropriate for that source level.This attribute is primarily intended to eliminate the time required by the automatic range selection performed by a sourcing instrument. Because selecting a fixed range prevents autoranging, an overrange condition can occur. For example, sourcing 10.0 V on the Model 2601B, 2602B, or 2604B 6 V range or sourcing 5.0 V on the 2611B, 2612B, or 2614B 2 V range causes an overrange condition.

Use a positive value for range to adjust the positive polarity and a negative value for range to adjust the negative polarity. Do not use 0.0 for a negative point; 0.0 is considered to be a positive number.Typically, the two points that are used are near zero for point 1 and 90% of full scale for point 2. Full scale for point 2 should be avoided if the source of the SMU is substantially out of calibration.The two reference measurements must be made with the source using the active calibration set. For example, source a value, measure it, and do not change the active calibration set before issuing this command.The new calibration constants are activated immediately but they are not written to nonvolatile memory.

--- *Details:*<br>
--- This attribute contains a value that sets the source‑measure unit (SMU) to a fixed range large enough to source the value. When read, the attribute contains the range the instrument is presently on when in autorange.Assigning a value to this attribute sets the SMU to a fixed range large enough to source the assigned value. The instrument selects the best range for sourcing a value of rangeValue.Reading this attribute returns the positive full-scale value of the source range the SMU is currently using. With source autoranging enabled, the output level controls the range. Querying the range after the level is set returns the range the instrument chose as appropriate for that source level.This attribute is primarily intended to eliminate the time required by the automatic range selection performed by a sourcing instrument. Because selecting a fixed range prevents autoranging, an overrange condition can occur. For example, sourcing 10.0 V on the Model 2601B, 2602B, or 2604B 6 V range or sourcing 5.0 V on the 2611B, 2612B, or 2614B 2 V range causes an overrange condition.

--- These attributes are used to read or write to the standard event status registers. Reading a status register returns a value. The binary equivalent of the returned value indicates which register bits are set. The least significant bit of the binary number is bit B0, and the most significant bit is bit B15. For example, if a value of 1.29000e+02 (which is 129) is read as the value of the condition register, the binary equivalent is 0000 0000 1000 0001. This value indicates that bit B0 and bit B7 are set.* Least significant bit** Most significant bitFor information about .condition, .enable, .event, .ntr, and .ptr registers, refer to Status register set contents and Enable and transition registers. The individual bits of this register are defined in the following table.As an example, to set bit B0 of the standard event status enable register, set status.standard.enable = status.standard.OPC.In addition to the above constants, standardRegister can be set to the numeric equivalent of the bit to set. To set more than one bit of the register, set standardRegister to the sum of their decimal weights. For example, to set bits B0 and B4, set standardRegister to 17 (which is the sum of 1 + 16).

--- In an expanded system (TSP-Link), these attributes are used to read or write to the system summary registers. They are set using a constant or a numeric value but are returned as a numeric value. The binary equivalent of the value indicates which register bits are set. In the binary equivalent, the least significant bit is bit B0, and the most significant bit is bit B15. For example, if a value of 1.29000e+02 (which is 129) is read as the value of the condition register, the binary equivalent is 0000 0000 1000 0001. This value indicates that bit B0 and bit B7 are set.* Least significant bit** Most significant bitFor information about .condition, .enable, .event, .ntr, and .ptr registers, refer to Status register set contents and Enable and transition registers. The individual bits of this register are defined in the following table.As an example, to set bit B0 of the system summary 2 enable register, set status.system2.enable = status.system2.EXT.In addition to the above constants, enableRegister can be set to the decimal value of the bit to set. To set more than one bit of the register, set enableRegister to the sum of their decimal values. For example, to set bits B11 and B14, set enableRegister to 18,432 (which is the sum of 2,048 + 16,384).

--- **This attribute defines the dynamic DNS host name.**
---
--- *Type:*  Attribute_RW
---
--- *Details:*<br>
--- This attribute holds the host name to request during dynamic DNS registration. Dynamic DNS registration works with DHCP to register the host name specified in this attribute with the DNS server.The factory default value for hostName is "k‑<model number>‑<serial number>", where <model number> and <serial number> are replaced with the actual model number and serial number of the instrument (for example, "k‑2602B‑1234567"). Note that hyphens separate the characters of hostName. The length of the fully qualified host name (combined length of the domain and host name with separator characters) must be less than or equal to 255 characters. Although up to 63 characters can be entered here, you must make sure the combined length is no more than 255 characters.Setting this attribute to an empty string (in other words, setting this attribute to a string of length zero or a string that consists entirely of whitespace characters) reverts the host name to the factory default value.

--- **This function sets the measurement event detector to the detected state.**
---
--- *Type:*  Function
---
--- *Details:*<br>
--- This function is useful whenever you want the SMU to continue operation without waiting for a programmed trigger event. When called, this function immediately satisfies the event detector, allowing the SMU to continue through the trigger model.For example, you might use this function to have the SMU immediately perform an action the first time through the trigger model, even if a programmed trigger event does not occur.If the event detectors are configured to clear automatically because the smuX.trigger.autoclear attribute is set to smuX.ENABLE, make sure that smuX.trigger.measure.set() is issued after the SMU has entered the trigger layer. This function can also be used to start actions on the SMU in case of a missed trigger event.The SMU automatically clears all event detectors when the smuX.trigger.initiate() function is executed. Call this function after the sweep is initiated.

--- Use this attribute to perform extended operating area pulse mode sweeps.If this attribute is set to smuX.LIMIT_AUTO (or 0), the SMU uses the normal limit setting during sweeping. If this attribute is set to any other numeric value, the SMU switches in this limit at the start of the source action and returns to the normal limit setting at the end of the end pulse action.Normally, the limit range is automatically adjusted in accordance with the limit value. During sweeping, however, the limit range is fixed to avoid the delays associated with changing range. This fixed limit range is determined by the maximum limit value needed during the sweep; that is, the greater of either the normal limit value (as specified by smuX.source.limitY) or the sweep limit value (as specified by smuX.trigger.source.limitY). The minimum limit value that can be enforced during the sweep is equal to 10% of the full‑scale value of the fixed limit range. If the smaller limit value (normal or sweep) falls below this 10% threshold, the 10% value is enforced instead. Likewise, if the limit value falls below the 10% threshold as a result of power compliance, the 10% value is enforced instead.When using the extended operating area, the SMU automatically starts the end pulse action if the SMU is not triggered before its maximum pulse width. It also delays the source action if necessary to limit the pulse duty cycle to stay within the capabilities of the SMU.

--- **This function configures a linear source sweep.**

--- *Type:*  Function
---
--- *Details:*<br>
--- This function configures the source action to be a linear source sweep in a subsequent sweep. During the sweep, the source generates a uniform series of ascending or descending voltage or current changes called steps. The number of source steps is one less than the number of sourced points.The points parameter does not set the number of steps in a sweep. Instead, it is used to calculate source values within a subsequent sweep. If the subsequent sweep has more points than specified in points, the source restarts at the beginning. This means that if the trigger count is greater than the number of points in a sweep as configured, the SMU satisfies the trigger count by restarting the sweep values from the beginning. If the subsequent sweep has fewer points than specified in points, endValue is not reached during the sweep. This means that if the trigger count is less than the number of source values configured, the SMU satisfies the trigger count and ignores the remaining source values.In cases where the first sweep point is a nonzero value, it may be necessary to pre-charge the circuit so that the sweep returns a stable value for the first measured point without penalizing remaining points in the sweep.With linear sweeps, it is acceptable to maintain a fixed source resolution over the entire sweep. To prevent source range changes during the sweep (especially when sweeping through 0.0), set the source range to a fixed range appropriate for the larger of either startValue or endValue. The SMU only stores the most recent configured source action. The last call to smuX.trigger.source.linearY(), smuX.trigger.source.listY(), or smuX.trigger.source.logY() is used for the source action.Source functions cannot be changed within a sweep.After configuring the sweep source values, enable the source action by setting smuX.trigger.source.action.

This allows log sweeps to cross zero. Setting this parameter to zero provides a conventional logarithmic sweep. The asymptote value is the value that the curve has at either positive or negative infinity, depending on the direction of the sweep.The asymptote value must not be equal to or between the starting and ending values.

--- *Type:*  Attribute_RW
---
--- *Details:*<br>
--- Use this attribute to perform extended operating area pulse mode sweeps.If this attribute is set to smuX.LIMIT_AUTO (or 0), the SMU uses the normal limit setting during sweeping. If this attribute is set to any other numeric value, the SMU switches in this limit at the start of the source action and returns to the normal limit setting at the end of the end pulse action.Normally, the limit range is automatically adjusted in accordance with the limit value. During sweeping, however, the limit range is fixed to avoid the delays associated with changing range. This fixed limit range is determined by the maximum limit value needed during the sweep; that is, the greater of either the normal limit value (as specified by smuX.source.limitY) or the sweep limit value (as specified by smuX.trigger.source.limitY). The minimum limit value that can be enforced during the sweep is equal to 10% of the full‑scale value of the fixed limit range. If the smaller limit value (normal or sweep) falls below this 10% threshold, the 10% value is enforced instead. Likewise, if the limit value falls below the 10% threshold as a result of power compliance, the 10% value is enforced instead.When using the extended operating area, the SMU automatically starts the end pulse action if the SMU is not triggered before its maximum pulse width. It also delays the source action if necessary to limit the pulse duty cycle to stay within the capabilities of the SMU.

--- **This function configures a linear source sweep.**
---
--- *Type:*  Function
---
--- *Details:*<br>
--- This function configures the source action to be a linear source sweep in a subsequent sweep. During the sweep, the source generates a uniform series of ascending or descending voltage or current changes called steps. The number of source steps is one less than the number of sourced points.The points parameter does not set the number of steps in a sweep. Instead, it is used to calculate source values within a subsequent sweep. If the subsequent sweep has more points than specified in points, the source restarts at the beginning. This means that if the trigger count is greater than the number of points in a sweep as configured, the SMU satisfies the trigger count by restarting the sweep values from the beginning. If the subsequent sweep has fewer points than specified in points, endValue is not reached during the sweep. This means that if the trigger count is less than the number of source values configured, the SMU satisfies the trigger count and ignores the remaining source values.In cases where the first sweep point is a nonzero value, it may be necessary to pre-charge the circuit so that the sweep returns a stable value for the first measured point without penalizing remaining points in the sweep.With linear sweeps, it is acceptable to maintain a fixed source resolution over the entire sweep. To prevent source range changes during the sweep (especially when sweeping through 0.0), set the source range to a fixed range appropriate for the larger of either startValue or endValue. The SMU only stores the most recent configured source action. The last call to smuX.trigger.source.linearY(), smuX.trigger.source.listY(), or smuX.trigger.source.logY() is used for the source action.Source functions cannot be changed within a sweep.After configuring the sweep source values, enable the source action by setting smuX.trigger.source.action.

--- This function configures the source action to be a geometric source sweep in a subsequent sweep. During the sweep, the source generates a geometric series of ascending or descending voltage or current changes called steps.

This allows log sweeps to cross zero. Setting this parameter to zero provides a conventional logarithmic sweep. The asymptote value is the value that the curve has at either positive or negative infinity, depending on the direction of the sweep.The asymptote value must not be equal to or between the starting and ending values. It must be outside the range defined by the starting and ending values.The SMU stores only the most recent configured source action.

--- These attributes are used to read or write to the questionable status unstable output summary registers. Reading a status register returns a value. The binary equivalent of the returned value indicates which register bits are set. The least significant bit of the binary number is bit B0, and the most significant bit is bit B15.For information about .condition, .enable, .event, .ntr, and .ptr registers, refer to Status register set contents and Enable and transition registers. The individual bits of this register are defined in the following table.As an example, to set bit B1 of the questionable status unstable output summary enable register, set status.questionable.instrument.enable = status.questionable.instrument.SMUA.In addition to the above constants, questionableRegister can be set to the numeric equivalent of the bit to set. To set more than one bit of the register, set operationRegister to the sum of their decimal weights. For example, to set bits B1 and B2, set questionableRegister to 6 (which is the sum of 2 + 4).

--- These attributes are used to read or write to the measurement event instrument summary registers. Reading a status register returns a value. The binary equivalent of the returned value indicates which register bits are set. The least significant bit of the binary number is bit B0, and the most significant bit is bit B15. For example, assume the value 6 is returned for the enable register. The binary equivalent is 0000 0000 0000 0110. This value indicates that bit B1 (SMUA) and bit B2 (SMUB) are set.For information about .condition, .enable, .event, .ntr, and .ptr registers, refer to Status register set contents and Enable and transition registers. The individual bits of this register are defined in the following table. As an example, to set bit B1 of the measurement event instrument summary enable register, set status.measurement.instrument.enable = status.measurement.instrument.SMUA.In addition to the above constants, measurementRegister can be set to the decimal equivalent of the bit to set. To set more than one bit of the register, set measurementRegister to the sum of their decimal weights. For example, to set bits B1 and B2, set measurementRegister to 6 (which is the sum of 2 + 4).

--- These attributes are used to read or write to the measurement event SMU X summary registers. Reading a status register returns a value. The binary equivalent of the returned value indicates which register bits are set. The least significant bit of the binary number is bit B0, and the most significant bit is bit B15. For example, assume the value 257 is returned for the enable register. The binary equivalent is 0000 0001 0000 0001. This value indicates that bit B0 (VLMT) and bit B8 (BAV) are set.* Least significant bit** Most significant bitFor information about .condition, .enable, .event, .ntr, and .ptr registers, refer to Status register set contents and Enable and transition registers. The individual bits of this register are defined in the following table.As an example, to set bit B0 of the measurement event SMU X summary enable register, set status.measurement.instrument.smua.enable = status.measurement.instrument.smua.VLMT.In addition to the above constants, measurementRegister can be set to the decimal equivalent of the bit to set. To set more than one bit of the register, set measurementRegister to the sum of their decimal weights. For example, to set bits B1 and B8, set measurementRegister to 258 (which is the sum of 2 + 256).

For example, if a value of 2.58000e+02 (which is 258) is read as the value of the condition register, the binary equivalent is 0000 0001 0000 0010. This value indicates that bit B1 and bit B8 are set.* Least significant bit** Most significant bitA set bit indicates that the specified LAN trigger generated an action overrun when triggered to generate a trigger packet.For information about .condition, .enable, .event, .ntr, and .ptr registers, refer to Status register set contents and Enable and transition registers. The individual bits of this register are defined in the following table.As an example, to set bit B1 of the operation status LAN trigger overrun enable register, set status.operation.instrument.lan.trigger_overrun.enable = status.operation.instrument.lan.trigger_overrun.LAN1.In addition to the above constants, operationRegister can be set to the numeric equivalent of the bit to set. To set more than one bit of the register, set operationRegister to the sum of their decimal weights. For example, to set bits B1 and B8, set operationRegister to 258 (which is the sum of 2 + 256).

--- These attributes are used to read or write to the operation status trigger timer overrun registers. Reading a status register returns a value. The binary equivalent of the returned value indicates which register bits are set. The least significant bit of the binary number is bit B0, and the most significant bit is bit B15. For example, if a value of 18 is read as the value of the condition register, the binary equivalent is 0000 0000 0001 0010. This value indicates that bit B1 and bit B4 are set.* Least significant bit** Most significant bitA set bit indicates the specified timer generated an action overrun because it was still processing a delay from a previous trigger when a new trigger was received.For information about .condition, .enable, .event, .ntr, and .ptr registers, refer to Status register set contents and Enable and transition registers. The individual bits of this register are defined in the following table.As an example, to set bit B1 of the operation status trigger timer trigger overrun enable register, set status.operation.instrument.trigger_timer.trigger_overrun.enable = status.operation.instrument.trigger_timer.trigger_overrun.TMR1.In addition to the above constants, operationRegister can be set to the numeric equivalent of the bit to set. To set more than one bit of the register, set operationRegister to the sum of their decimal weights. For example, to set bits B1 and B4, set operationRegister to 18 (which is the sum of 2 + 16).

For example, if a value of 18 is read as the value of the condition register, the binary equivalent is 0000 0000 0001 0010. This value indicates that bit B1 and bit B4 are set.* Least significant bit** Most significant bitA set bit value indicates that the specified trigger blender generated an action overrun.For information about .condition, .enable, .event, .ntr, and .ptr registers, refer to Status register set contents and Enable and transition registers. The individual bits of this register are defined in the following table.As an example, to set bit B1 of the operation status trigger blender overrun enable register, set status.operation.instrument.trigger_blender.trigger_overrun.enable = status.operation.instrument.trigger_blender.trigger_overrun.BLND1.In addition to the above constants, operationRegister can be set to the numeric equivalent of the bit to set. To set more than one bit of the register, set operationRegister to the sum of their decimal weights. For example, to set bits B1 and B4, set operationRegister to 18 (which is the sum of 2 + 16).

--- **This function resets commands to their default settings.**
---
--- *Type:*  Function
---
--- *Details:*<br>
--- The reset() command in its simplest form resets the entire TSP‑enabled system, including the controlling node and all subordinate nodes.If you want to reset a specific instrument, use either the localnode.reset() or node[X].reset() command. Use the localnode.reset() command for the local instrument. Use the node[X].reset() command to reset an instrument on a subordinate node.You can only reset the entire system using reset(true) if the node is the master. If the node is not the master node, executing this command generates an error.
